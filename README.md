I’d like to introduce you to a chatbot I developed for a T-shirt store. This chatbot is designed to provide customers with instant responses to common queries, like checking the stock availability of T-shirts, getting the price of products, and answering any other relevant store-related questions

To build this chatbot, I used:

Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand customer queries.
Python for building the backend logic.
Langchain and Colab for managing chatbot behavior and responses.

Here’s how the chatbot works:

A customer types a query, such as 'Do you have this T-shirt in stock?' or 'What’s the price of the blue T-shirt?'
The chatbot uses NLP to process the query and determine the intent behind it. For instance, if the customer is asking about stock or prices, the chatbot classifies the query accordingly.
The system is connected to a backend database where all the store’s product details are stored. Based on the customer’s query, the chatbot retrieves real-time information from the database and provides an accurate response.
The user receives an instant reply with the relevant details, such as stock availability or pricing.

In conclusion, this chatbot is a simple yet effective solution to streamline the customer experience at the T-shirt store. By automating responses to common queries, the chatbot enhances customer satisfaction while saving time for the store's staff.
